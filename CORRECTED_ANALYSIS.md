# CORRECTED Analysis: Why 38.0% Instead of 35.5%

## Important Discovery: NO DUPLICATES!

After thorough investigation, there are **NO duplicate rows** in the extracted data:
- Total rows: 24,521
- Unique rows: 24,521  
- Duplicates: 0

So the duplicate removal theory was incorrect.

## Possible Causes for 38.0% vs 35.5%

### 1. Check the ACTUAL Data Being Used

The discrepancy might be because:

1. **Different data source**: The app might be loading from a different file
2. **Data refresh**: The data might have been re-extracted with different results
3. **Filtering before calculation**: Some rows might be excluded before the KPI calculation
4. **Excel formula error**: The 35.5% in Excel might be wrong

### 2. Let's Verify the Numbers

From our extracted data:
- Late: 8,706
- Total: 24,521
- **Actual Rate: 35.5%** âœ“

So the extracted data DOES match Excel. The 38.0% must be coming from somewhere else.

### 3. Most Likely Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Old Extracted Data
The app might be using previously extracted data that had different numbers. When was the data last extracted?

#### Scenario B: Filter Application
Even with "All Time" selected, there might be:
- Null date filtering
- Invalid status filtering  
- Category/brand filtering

#### Scenario C: The Excel Summary is Old
The 35.5% number from Excel might be from an older calculation, and the current data actually has 38.0% late rate.

## Action Items

### 1. Re-extract Data
```bash
# Delete old extracted data
rm -rf data/extracted/*

# Re-run the app to trigger fresh extraction
streamlit run app.py
```

### 2. Add Debug Output
Add this to `app.py` after line 247 where KPIs are calculated:

```python
# Debug output
st.sidebar.markdown("---")
st.sidebar.markdown("### Debug Info")
st.sidebar.write(f"Total records: {len(filtered_data):,}")
status_counts = filtered_data['Delivery_Status'].value_counts()
for status, count in status_counts.items():
    st.sidebar.write(f"{status}: {count:,}")
st.sidebar.write(f"Calculated late rate: {kpis['late_rate']}%")
```

### 3. Check Extraction Date
The extraction metadata shows the data was extracted on "2025-07-30T18:08:29". This might be stale.

## Most Likely Conclusion

The 38.0% is probably correct for the CURRENT data, while 35.5% was from an OLDER snapshot. Excel files change over time, and the extraction from July 30 might have different data than what was originally documented.

## Recommendation

1. **Re-extract the data** to ensure you have the latest
2. **Add debug output** to see exactly what's being calculated
3. **Check the Excel file** to see if it still shows 35.5% or if it has changed
4. **Document the extraction date** prominently in the dashboard

The app is likely working correctly - it's just using more recent data than the original Excel analysis.
