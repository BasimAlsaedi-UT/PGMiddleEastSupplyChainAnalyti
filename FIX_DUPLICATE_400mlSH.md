# Fix for Duplicate 400mlSH Products in IOUs Analysis

## The Problem
The "Product Details" table was showing 5 rows all with "400mlSH" as the product name, making it impossible to distinguish between different products.

## Root Cause
The data has multiple products with the same `Planning Level` value of "400mlSH", but they are actually different products:
- Different brands (H&S, Herbal, Pantene)
- Different channels (Discounters, E-Commerce, Pharma)
- Different specific products (H&S, Supreme SH, Herbal Ctln SH, etc.)

Example from the data:
```
Pharma, Hair Care, H&S, H&S, 400mlSH - IOUs: 0.341
Pharma, Hair Care, H&S, Supreme SH, 400mlSH - IOUs: 0.004
Pharma, Hair Care, Herbal, Herbal SH, 400mlSH - IOUs: 0.221
E-Commerce, Hair Care, Herbal, Herbal SH, 400mlSH - IOUs: 0.0
Discounters, Hair Care, Pantene, Pantene Serim, 400mlSH - IOUs: 0.0
```

## The Fix
1. **Added unique identifiers** by combining Planning Level with Brand and Channel
2. **Created Product_Display column**: "400mlSH (H&S, Pharma)" format
3. **Updated all displays** to show the unique identifier:
   - Bar chart x-axis
   - Product Details table
   - Products Needing Attention section

## Result
Now the table and charts will show:
- "400mlSH (H&S, Pharma)" - 0.34 IOUs
- "400mlSH (Herbal SH, Pharma)" - 0.22 IOUs
- "400mlSH (Supreme SH, Pharma)" - 0.004 IOUs
- etc.

This makes it clear that these are different products, not duplicates.

## Business Insight
The "400mlSH" appears to be a standard package size (400ml shampoo) used across multiple brands and channels. The Planning Level should ideally include more specific product information to avoid this confusion.
