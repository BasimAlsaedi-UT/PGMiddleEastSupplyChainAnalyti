### 2. Demand Forecasting ✅

#### Data Preparation:
- Aggregates daily shipment counts
- Date range: June 18, 2025 to August 13, 2025
- Uses Prophet (if available) or Moving Average fallback

#### Forecast Calculations:
- **30-Day Forecast** with confidence intervals
- **Seasonality Components**:
  - Weekly pattern (7-day cycle)
  - Monthly pattern (30.5-day cycle)
  - Yearly pattern (if data permits)

#### Metrics Displayed:
- **Average Daily Forecast**: Mean of future predictions ✅
- **Peak Day**: Maximum predicted value and date ✅
- **Total 30-Day Volume**: Sum of all future predictions ✅

#### Weekly Breakdown Calculation:
```python
Week = date.isocalendar().week
Weekly sum = Sum of daily forecasts by week
```

### 3. Anomaly Detection ✅

#### Method: Isolation Forest
- **Contamination Rate**: 5% (expects 5% anomalies)
- **Features Used**:
  - Quantity (numeric)
  - Delay_Days (numeric)
  - Late_Binary (0/1 derived from Delivery_Status)

#### Anomaly Statistics:
- Uses StandardScaler for normalization
- Anomaly score: Lower values = more anomalous
- Is_Anomaly: 1 if anomaly, 0 if normal

#### Visualizations:
1. **Scatter Plot**: Delay_Days vs Quantity, colored by anomaly status ✅
2. **Category Summary Table**: Anomaly counts by category ✅
3. **Sample Anomalies Table**: Top anomalous shipments ✅

### 4. Route Optimization Analysis ✅

#### Optimization Score Formula (Verified):
```
Optimization_Score = 
    Late_Rate × 0.5 +
    Avg_Delay × 0.3 +
    (Volume / Max_Volume × 100) × 0.2
```

Where:
- **Late_Rate**: Percentage of late deliveries on route
- **Avg_Delay**: Average delay in days
- **Volume**: Total quantity shipped on route

#### Route Performance Metrics:
- Groups by (Source, SLS_Plant) pairs
- Higher score = More optimization potential

#### Example Calculation:
For route "IATCO WH → Plant 1001":
- Late Rate: 40% × 0.5 = 20.0
- Avg Delay: 3.5 days × 0.3 = 1.05
- Volume Score: (1000/5000 × 100) × 0.2 = 4.0
- **Total Score**: 25.05

#### Visualizations:
1. **Heatmap**: Source × Plant optimization scores ✅
2. **Top 10 Routes Table**: Sorted by optimization potential ✅
3. **Recommendations**: Based on thresholds ✅

### 5. Model Training Process ✅

#### When "Train All Models" is clicked:
1. **Late Delivery Model**:
   - Trains RandomForestClassifier (100 trees, max_depth=10)
   - 80/20 train/test split with stratification
   - Returns accuracy, AUC, feature importance

2. **Demand Forecast**:
   - Fits Prophet model with custom seasonality
   - Or falls back to 30-day moving average
   - Generates 30-day future predictions

3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Fits IsolationForest on scaled features
   - Labels anomalies in dataset
   - Returns anomaly statistics

### 6. Error Handling ✅

The code includes comprehensive error handling:
- Missing dependencies fallback to simple models
- Missing columns handled gracefully
- Division by zero prevented
- Invalid data filtered out
- All visualizations wrapped in try-except blocks

### 7. Key Insights Generation ✅

Automatic insights based on:
- Model accuracy > 80% → Success message
- Demand trend (increasing/decreasing)
- Anomaly rate > 5% → Warning message

## Summary

All calculations, formulas, and visualizations in the ML Predictions tab are:
