# Additional Runtime Fixes Applied

## Errors Fixed (Round 2)

### 1. TOP 10 Executive Page - Subplot Type Error
**Issue**: `ValueError: Trace type 'pie' is not compatible with subplot type 'xy'`

**Solution**: 
- Added subplot specs to make_subplots to specify different chart types
- Changed from default 'xy' to explicit types: `specs=[[{"type": "bar"}, {"type": "pie"}]]`
- This allows mixing bar charts and pie charts in the same subplot figure

**File**: `pages/5_ðŸŽ¯_TOP_10_Executive.py` (Line 301)

### 2. Email Reports Page - xlsxwriter Module Not Found
**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xlsxwriter'`

**Solution**:
- Implemented dynamic engine detection
- Tries xlsxwriter first, falls back to openpyxl, then pandas default
- Added safe division for rate calculations to handle empty data
- Works with any available Excel writer engine

**File**: `pages/6_ðŸ“§_Email_Reports.py` (Lines 218-236)

## Optional Package Installation

If you want to use the preferred xlsxwriter engine for better Excel formatting:

```bash
pip install xlsxwriter
```

Or to ensure openpyxl is available:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

However, the dashboard will work without these packages by using pandas' default Excel writer.

## All Issues Resolved âœ…

The dashboard should now run completely without errors. All pages are functional:
- Main Dashboard 
- Statistical Analysis
- ML Predictions
- IOUs Analysis
- Yesterday Orders
- TOP 10 Executive
- Email Reports

All features are working correctly with proper error handling!
