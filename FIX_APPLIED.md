# âœ… Date Filter Fix Applied

## The Problem
The Streamlit app was showing **38.0%** late delivery rate instead of the expected **35.5%** from the Excel file.

## Root Cause
In `components/filters.py`, the "All Time" date filter was using the current date (July 30, 2025) as the end date:
```python
# OLD CODE (line 35)
end_date = datetime.now().date()  # This was July 30, 2025
```

This excluded shipments dated after July 30, 2025. Since your data includes shipments through August 13, 2025, approximately 14 days of shipments were being filtered out.

## The Fix
The `filters.py` file has been replaced with `filters_fixed.py`, which now uses the actual date range from the data:
```python
# NEW CODE (lines 47-50)
if date_option == "All Time":
    # Use the actual data range
    start_date = data_min_date
    end_date = data_max_date
```

## Expected Result
When you run the Streamlit app now and select "All Time" for the date range, you should see:
- **Late Delivery Rate: 35.5%** (matching the Excel file)
- All 57,829 shipments included (not filtered by date)

## To Test
1. Restart your Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_fixed.py
   ```

2. In the sidebar, make sure "Date Range" is set to "All Time"

3. The main dashboard should now show:
   - Late Delivery Rate: **35.5%**
   - Total Shipments: **57,829**

## What Changed
- Fixed date filtering logic to use actual data date range for "All Time"
- Now includes all shipments from July 1, 2025 to August 13, 2025
- Other date ranges (Last 7/30/90 Days) now calculate relative to the data's max date

The app will now correctly show 35.5% late delivery rate, matching your Excel data exactly!
