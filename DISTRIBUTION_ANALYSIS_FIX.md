# Distribution Analysis Fix - Session State Implementation

## Problem Description
The user reported two issues in the Distribution Analysis tab:
1. Distribution analysis results disappear when calculating confidence intervals
2. Transformation buttons don't do anything when clicked

## Root Cause
The issues were caused by:
1. Streamlit rerunning the entire script when any button is clicked, clearing temporary results
2. Transformation buttons only displayed info messages without actually transforming data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Session State for Persistent Results
- Added `st.session_state.dist_analysis_results` to store analysis results
- Results persist across button clicks and page reruns
- Each column's results are stored separately with keys

### 2. Column Change Detection
- Track current selected column in `st.session_state.current_dist_col`
- Clear previous results when user switches to a different column
- Prevents confusion from showing old results for different data

### 3. Functional Transformation Buttons
Both Log and Square Root transformation buttons now:
- Extract the original data from session state
- Apply the mathematical transformation
- Handle edge cases (negative values, zeros)
- Re-run distribution analysis on transformed data
- Display new plots and normality test results
- Show success/failure messages based on normality tests

### 4. Separated Confidence Intervals Section
- Added visual separator (horizontal line) between sections
- Store CI results separately in `st.session_state.ci_results`
- Display previous CI results if they exist
- Prevents interference between distribution analysis and CI calculation

## Technical Details

### Log Transformation
```python
# Handle negative or zero values
if min_val <= 0:
    transformed_data = np.log(original_data - min_val + 1)
else:
    transformed_data = np.log(original_data)
```

### Square Root Transformation
```python
# Handle negative values
if min_val < 0:
    transformed_data = np.sqrt(original_data - min_val)
else:
    transformed_data = np.sqrt(original_data)
```

### Session State Structure
```python
st.session_state.dist_analysis_results = {
    'column_name': {
        'fig': plotly_figure,
        'normality_results': dict,
        'original_data': pandas_series
    },
    'column_name_log_transformed': {...},
    'column_name_sqrt_transformed': {...}
}
```

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Persistence**: Analysis results stay visible when interacting with other controls
2. **Feedback**: Clear success/error messages for all operations
3. **Guidance**: Transformation results show whether data became normal
4. **Clarity**: Separated sections prevent confusion about which results belong where

## Testing Recommendations
1. Analyze a column's distribution
2. Calculate confidence intervals - distribution results should remain visible
3. Apply transformations - should see new plots and test results
4. Switch between columns - should clear previous results
5. Return to a previously analyzed column - should need to re-analyze

The fix ensures a smooth, intuitive workflow for statistical distribution analysis!
