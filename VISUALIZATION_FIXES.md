# Visualization Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Yesterday Orders - Late Rate by Category Plot Shows No Data

**Issue**: The "Late Rate by Category" bar chart in the Category Analysis tab was showing no data.

**Root Cause**: Division by zero when calculating late rates resulted in NaN values, which don't display in bar charts.

**Solution**: 
- Used `np.where` for safe division
- When Total_Today or Total_Yesterday is 0, the late rate is set to 0 instead of NaN
- This ensures all categories display properly in the visualization

**Code Changed**:
```python
# Before: Direct division causing NaN
category_comp['Late_Rate_Today'] = (category_comp['Late_Today'] / category_comp['Total_Today'] * 100).round(1)

# After: Safe division with np.where
category_comp['Late_Rate_Today'] = np.where(
    category_comp['Total_Today'] > 0,
    (category_comp['Late_Today'] / category_comp['Total_Today'] * 100).round(1),
    0
)
```

### 2. ML Predictions - Seasonality Patterns Show No Data

**Issue**: Both Weekly and Monthly seasonality pattern charts were showing empty/zero values.

**Root Cause**: The Prophet model's seasonality components ('weekly', 'yearly' columns) weren't directly accessible in the forecast dataframe.

**Solution**:
- Changed approach to calculate seasonality effect as: `effect = yhat - trend`
- This shows how much the prediction deviates from the underlying trend due to seasonality
- Added color coding (green for positive effect, red for negative)
- Added horizontal zero line for reference
- Added informative messages when Prophet is not installed

**Visual Improvements**:
- Weekly Pattern: Shows which days of the week have higher/lower demand
- Monthly Pattern: Shows which months have higher/lower demand
- Both charts now use colors to indicate positive (green) vs negative (red) effects

## Expected Results

### Yesterday Orders:
- The "Late Rate by Category" chart should now show bars for all categories
- Categories with no shipments will show 0% late rate instead of being missing

### ML Predictions:
- If Prophet is installed and models are trained, you should see:
  - Weekly pattern showing variation across days of the week
  - Monthly pattern showing seasonal variation across months
- If Prophet is not installed, you'll see an informative message to install it

## Notes

The seasonality patterns will only show meaningful data if:
1. Prophet is installed (`pip install prophet`)
2. The ML models have been trained (click "Train All Models")
3. There's sufficient historical data to detect patterns

If the patterns still show as flat (all zeros), it may indicate:
- The data doesn't have strong weekly/monthly seasonality
- The model needs more historical data to detect patterns
- Prophet is not installed or not importing correctly
