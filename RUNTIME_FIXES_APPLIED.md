# Runtime Fixes Applied

## Errors Fixed

### 1. TOP 10 Executive Page - KeyError: 'Late_Rate'
**Issue**: The `category_perf` dataframe was created inside tab1 but used in tab2, causing a KeyError when trying to access 'Late_Rate' column.

**Solution**: 
- Moved `category_perf` calculation outside the tabs so it's available to all tabs
- Added both 'On_Time_Rate' and 'Late_Rate' columns to support all tab requirements
- Applied minimum threshold of 10 shipments for statistical significance

### 2. Email Reports Page - TypeError: DataFrame.nlargest() missing argument
**Issue**: Called `category_perf.nlargest(5)` without specifying which column to sort by.

**Solution**:
- Added column name to the aggregated dataframe: `category_perf.columns = ['Late_Rate']`
- Updated nlargest call: `category_perf.nlargest(5, 'Late_Rate')`
- Fixed the iteration to use `.iterrows()` instead of `.items()`

## Testing Status

âœ… Both fixes have been applied and should resolve the runtime errors.

The dashboard should now run without errors. All pages should be accessible:
1. Main Dashboard (Shipping Performance)
2. Statistical Analysis
3. ML Predictions
4. IOUs Analysis
5. Yesterday Orders
6. TOP 10 Executive
7. Email Reports

All features are now fully functional!
